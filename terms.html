                                    essential that these are complied with in full. There are important health
                                    considerations when using the tub and it is your responsibility to ensure that the
                                    use of the hot tub would not be detrimental to your health.</li>

                                    prior to your arrival.</li>
                                <li>3. You may not use the Hot Tub if suffering from any condition which may be passed
                                    to others or if under the influence of any drug including alcohol.</li>
                                <li>4. We do not provide any safety surveillance of the Hot Tub. It is the
                                    responsibility of the person in whose name the holiday is booked to ensure that
                                    those using the Hot Tub do so safely.</li>

                                <li>3. We expect that the property is left in the condition in which you found it.
                                    Although we are unlikely to charge for minor breakages which may occur during your
                                    stay, we will seek compensation from you for any damage which may be more serious
                                    in nature. We do, therefore, recommend that you have insurance against accidental
